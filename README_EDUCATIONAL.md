# 🎓 Educational Phishing Awareness Demo

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT FOR CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS**

This project is a phishing demonstration created for a college final year project. It is designed to:
- Educate users about phishing attacks
- Demonstrate how credential theft works
- Raise security awareness
- Show the importance of verifying website authenticity

## 🚫 Legal Notice

**DO NOT USE THIS FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES**

- This is for **EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY**
- Must be used in **CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS** (your college network)
- Requires **EXPLICIT PERMISSION** from network administrators
- **NEVER** use to collect real credentials
- Violating these terms may result in criminal prosecution

## 📚 Project Purpose

### Educational Goals
1. **Demonstrate Phishing Techniques**: Show how attackers create fake login pages
2. **Security Awareness**: Teach users to identify suspicious websites
3. **Data Collection Demo**: Illustrate what information phishing sites capture
4. **Prevention Education**: Help users protect themselves

### What This Demonstrates
- ✅ How phishing pages mimic legitimate sites
- ✅ What data can be captured (phone, password, IP)
- ✅ How attackers use social engineering
- ✅ Importance of checking URLs and certificates

## 🎯 Proper Usage

### For Your College Project

1. **Get Permission**
   - Obtain written approval from your college
   - Get network administrator authorization
   - Document the educational purpose

2. **Controlled Environment**
   - Use only on your college network
   - Limit access to project participants
   - Don't make publicly accessible

3. **Clear Communication**
   - Always show the disclaimer page first
   - Explain it's a demo before use
   - Never trick people into using it

4. **Documentation**
   - Keep records of who accessed it
   - Document educational outcomes
   - Include in project report

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### What Makes This Educational

1. **Prominent Disclaimers**: Clear warnings on every page
2. **No Real Data**: Instructions to use fake credentials only
3. **Controlled Access**: Limited to authorized users
4. **Educational Context**: Part of formal coursework
5. **Supervised Use**: Under faculty guidance

### Chrome Warning Explanation

Chrome shows warnings because:
- The site mimics Instagram's appearance
- It collects login credentials
- Google Safe Browsing flags it as phishing

**This is EXPECTED and CORRECT behavior** - it proves the security systems work!

   - Explain educational purpose
   - Show ethics approval
   - Emphasize controlled environment

2. **Demonstrate the Attack**
   - Show how phishing works
   - Explain social engineering
   - Display captured data

3. **Teach Prevention**
   - How to spot fake sites
   - Importance of URL checking
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Security best practices

4. **Show Chrome's Protection**
