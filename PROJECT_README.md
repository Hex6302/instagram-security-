# Security Awareness Project - Phishing Demonstration

## ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

This project is a **security awareness demonstration** created for educational purposes to show how phishing attacks work and how to protect against them.

## 🎓 Project Purpose

**College Final Year Project**: Security Awareness and Phishing Prevention

### Objectives
1. Demonstrate how phishing pages mimic legitimate websites
2. Educate users on identifying phishing attempts
3. Show the importance of URL verification
4. Highlight the need for two-factor authentication
5. Raise awareness about credential theft

## 📋 Project Scope

### Authorized Use
- ✅ Educational demonstrations in controlled environments
- ✅ Security awareness training sessions
- ✅ Academic presentations and research
- ✅ Authorized penetration testing with written permission

### Prohibited Use
- ❌ Collecting real user credentials without authorization
- ❌ Deploying on public internet to deceive users
- ❌ Any malicious or illegal activities
- ❌ Impersonating Instagram for fraudulent purposes

## 🛡️ Ethical Guidelines

### For Presenters/Educators
1. **Always show the disclaimer page first**
2. **Clearly label this as a demonstration**
3. **Use only test/dummy credentials**
4. **Explain the techniques being demonstrated**
5. **Teach prevention methods**

### For Participants
1. **Never enter real Instagram credentials**
2. **Understand this is a learning exercise**
3. **Learn to identify phishing indicators**
4. **Apply lessons to real-world scenarios**

## 🔍 What This Demonstrates

### Phishing Techniques Shown
- **Visual Mimicry**: How attackers copy legitimate site designs
- **URL Spoofing**: Using similar-looking domains
- **Data Collection**: How credentials are captured
- **Social Engineering**: Psychological manipulation tactics

### Security Lessons
- **Always verify URLs** before entering credentials
- **Look for HTTPS** and valid certificates
- **Enable 2FA** on all important accounts
- **Be suspicious** of unexpected login requests
- **Report phishing** attempts to proper authorities

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Components
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (mimics Instagram UI)
- **Backend**: Python Flask server
- **Database**: MongoDB (stores demonstration data)
- **Disclaimer**: Educational warning page

### Data Flow
1. User sees disclaimer and educational warning
2. User acknowledges this is a demonstration
3. User enters test credentials (NOT real ones)
4. Data is stored in MongoDB for demonstration
5. User is shown what data was collected
